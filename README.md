## Synopsis
### Game
<p>In the far reaches of the universe lies planet L2klbs. L2klbs is renowned for it's harsh weather and environment. It is up to you and your species to survive! </p>

### History
<p>Gregor Mendel, the pioneer of modern genetics utilized punnett squares to map out the genetic traits of species. Use these genetic concepts to procreate and survive the intense terrain.</p>

This represents how many days you have currently survived. The weather will display the current type of weather. This can range from drought to ice-age. Below the weather is the info section. When an organism is selected you will be able to view their genetic code. As well as additional information such as sex. In the bottom container, organisms will be dragged. When two organisms are select, they can be bred to produce the next generation. Once they are in use, they will not be available till the next day.</p>
